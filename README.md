# C++ library for parallel programming on a distributed system

The library should provide an interface to describe parallel computation on distributed systems in terms of tasks and their relations.
The main idea is to manage and maintain task execution on a cluster efficiently in a fault-tolerant way.
The library should handle distributed task dispatching, scheduling, basic I/O functionalities, and node communication. 
Consequently, the programmer doesn't have to worry about cluster management and can write the code as for a single entity.
